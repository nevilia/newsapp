# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

** Issues:
 • with react-router-dom version 6.4+ there is update regarding the  createBrowserRouter (https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router) child elements of routes and Outlet etc
 • the api data handeling and rendering has been updated to loader and useLoaderData (https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/loader)
 • the routes are getting updated in the url but related content is not rendering (until Reload).
 • If anyone knows how to fix the routes using the latest concepts as in the documentation, feel free to reach out
